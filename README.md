# CSS and JavaScript Clock

Build of the CSS & JavaScript Clock from Wes Bos's #JavaScript30 Challenge. Find more information [here](https://javascript30.com/)!

Using CSS and JavaScript, build a clock with three independently moving hands which indicate the current time. Hour, Minute, and Second hands move around the clock according to the current date, tracking their respective measurements of time.

**Notes:** Work on disabling the transformation when rotation = 90degrees for the hands, to avoid the transformation blip that currently occurs.
